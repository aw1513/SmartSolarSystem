# SmartSolarSystem

Climate change requires actions by everyone. Renewable energy is an essential ingredient where private house owners play a crucial role. 
The integration of renewable energy into existing power grids is making slow progress. It is challenging due to its inherent production flucutuations which cause grid instabilities. 
To accelerate and facilitate the integration of renewables it is therefore indispensible to find technical solutions to increase the stability. Our SmartSolarSystem application is one important piece to solve this puzzle through the optimisation of self-consumption.

System description:

fully decentralized, optimise self-consumption

We combine machine learning with blockchain to create a smart home with an incentive to minimise the strain on the electrical grid. This empowers the smart home owners to optimise their self-consumption with a smart optimiser taking into account state-of-the art prediction of the solar energy production.
